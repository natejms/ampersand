Just to start things off, thanks for taking interest in contributing to this
project!

The goal of this document is to help people interested in contributing to
Ampersand get started. *These aren't rules. This is just a guide.* If you
feel like something has been left out, feel free to propose changes via a
pull request.

## How to contribute

Of course, all contributions are welcome. However, if you're not sure where
to start, here are a few places to kick things off:

 * Bug tracking and testing
 * Suggesting enhancements and features
 * Core development and bug fixing
 * Plugin development
 * Documentation

### Bug tracking and testing

All of the bug tracking is done on Github to keep things simple.

If you believe you've encountered a bug within Ampersand,

 * Be sure that the bug is being caused by Ampersand and not a plugin or any
 other code not coming directly from Ampersand. If it's being caused by a
 plugin for instance, submit a bug report on its repository instead.
 * Ensure that a bug report hasn't already been filed for what you've dug up.

Once you know what you're dealing with, head on over to the issues section
and create a new issue. Try to **be as clear and descriptive as possible**.
**Include any error messages** and **tell us what you expected**. You should
also say what version of Ampersand you're using as the bug might have been
patched in a later update.

### Suggesting enhancements and features

This one's fairly simple: if you have an idea that could improve Ampersand,
tell us about it! All suggestions are welcome. However, keep in mind the
philosophy of Ampersand. Ampersand is not Jekyll, nor Hexo or Hugo.
Ampersand is Ampersand, and Ampersand is a minimalistic static site generator
primarily used to manage translations of a website. Many features
(such as storing long translations in external files or compiling
markdown) would be extremely useful, though they would make more sense as
plugins. If this is the case, suggest a new plugin!

### Core development and bug fixing (pull requests)

If you're not sure where to start, check out the issues page and see if you
can't find something to work on.

For the most part, our conventions derive from
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the style guide for Python
code.

Once you have made your changes, open a pull request and wait for it to be
reviewed. Ideally, this shouldn't take too long. If it is, then try
reaching out to one of the maintainers.

### Plugin development

Plugin development is detailed in the documentation.

To make your plugin available to Ampersand users, it must be hosted online as a
Git repository. The easiest way to do this would be to host it on Github.

### Documentation

Documentation is an incredibly important part of every open source project.
If writing is something you would be interested in doing, then try and find
a less detailed page to get started, or create a new page all together!

Try searching for issues with the
[documentation label](https://github.com/natejms/ampersand/labels/documentation)
to find something to work on.

Aim to make your writing as descriptive as possible while keeping it at a
reasonable length.

## Final notes

Once again, thanks for taking the time to help out the project! After reading
this document, you may still have questions. If so, try reaching out to one of
the project maintainers.
